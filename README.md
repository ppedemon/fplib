# fplib
Functional programming goodies for Python. Inspired by [PyMonad](https://github.com/fnl/pymonad),
[monet.js](https://monet.github.io/monet.js/), and [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz).

# Todos
  - [x] Tests for all Monoid instances.
  - [x] Tests for all Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances.
  - [x] Complete Maybe interace (getOrElse, filter, orElse, ...).
  - [ ] Complete List interface (take, drop, takeWhile, ...).
  - [x] Add Monad transformers.
  - [ ] Add extra monad classes: MonadPlus, MonadZero, MonadState, MonadWrite, etc.
  - [ ] Add extra monads: Pairs, Either, Writer, Free, Continuation.
  - [ ] Define convenience monad functions: sequence, when, join, etc.
  - [ ] Add Kleisli stuff: composition, filterM, mapM, foldM, etc.
  - [ ] Add Traversable and Foldable classes.
  - [ ] Co stuff: CoFunctors, CoMonads, CoApplicatives
  - [ ] General categorical stuff: Adjoints, Natural transformations, Yoneda, Bifunctors.
